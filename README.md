# DoodleJumpDemo
This project is a prototype created based on doodle Jump mechanics, Just with different graphics! 

This includes: 
A character which jumps from one platform to another 
○ The character jumps automatically 
○ Character controls 
○ moving left/right - left/right keys 
○ One infinite level 
○ The game is over when the character falls out of the screen 
○ Replayable game after losing, without restarting the Unity scene 

Other Game Elements : 
■ Platform: A static platform that stays and can be jumped upon multiple times
■ Destroyable platform: The character can touch them only once
■ Moving platforms: (horizontal/vertical) ping pong moving platforms
■ Spring platforms: for higher jumps 


For UI: Unity Canvas is being used  
○ Intro animation (Main Menu screen): Tap To Play text appears when animation is over and then game can be started by tapping the screeen
○ Outro animation, presenting new score at game over 
○ UI feedback shows the number of platforms the character jumped on
